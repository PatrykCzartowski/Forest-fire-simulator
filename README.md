# Forest-fire-simulator
A console-based forest fire simulation written in Rust that demonstrates how fires spread through different types of forests.


# ðŸŒ² Features
* Dynamic forest generation with customizable size and density
* Different tree types with unique burning properties:
  * Pine: Highly flammable, burns quickly
  * Oak: Less flammable, burns slowly
  * Birch: Medium flammability and burn rate
  * Redwood: Fire resistant, burns very slowly
* Realistic natural water bodies that act as fire barriers
* Lightning strikes that initiate fires
* Visual representation of fire progression with colored text
* Statistics tracking for different tree types and burn percentages

# ðŸ“Š Simulation Mechanics
The simulation models several aspects of forest fires:
1. **Fire Spread**: Fires spread to adjacent trees based on each tree's flammability rating
2. **Burn Duration**: Different tree types burn for different amounts of time
3. **Water Barriers**: Natural water bodies in the forest prevent fire from spreading
4. **Fire Lifecycle**: Trees transition through several states:
   * Alive â†’ Struck (by lightning) â†’ Kindling â†’ Burning â†’ Burned

  
# ðŸ“‹ Getting Started
Prerequisites
* Rust and Cargo (1.56.0 or higher)
Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest-fire-simulator.git
cd forest-fire-simulator
```
2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
3. Run the simulation:
```bash
cargo run --release
```


# ðŸŽ® Usage
1. At startup, you'll be prompted to configure:
   * Forest size (10-100)
   * Forest density (0.1-1.0)
   * Water density (0.0-0.5)
2. Once the forest is generated:
   * Press Enter to simulate a lightning strike
   * Press 'q' to quit the simulation
3. Watch as the fire spreads based on tree types and forest composition
